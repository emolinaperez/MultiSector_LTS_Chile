This moodel is a little behind than the waste model. 
I have bypassed some of the more tricky parts until I'm comfortable with the code, but still the model should give you results (they SHOULD differ a lot from the final results).

The variable Emisiones gives the result for different scenarios in ktCO2e by the different sub-sectors included in the GHG inventories according to the IPCC.

I'm guessing this should be enough just to make the connections, but if you need something else please let me know.
