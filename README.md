# MultiSector_LTS_Chile
Multisector model for Chile's Long-term Climate Strategy

Note: this model requires python 3.7.
Quick ref for running the model:
cd …/multisector_model/python
python experimental_design.py
python run_sector_models.py

Check:
multisector_model/experimental_design for all experimental design files
multisector_model/out for all model results files
 (1) Download and open multisector_model.zip. After the file has downloaded, leave the file structure in place.
 (2) The model has two primary scripts located in multisector_model/python that are
executed:
           a. experimental_design.py: experimental_design.py is used to generate the experimental design that the model iterates over. Several attribute files — located in the attribute folder — can be modified to include/exclude different scenarios associated with each uncertainty dimension. A brief description of each uncertainty dimension is included below:
              design_id:
                    design_id represents uncertainty in achieving goals, or how closely levers come to achieving anticipated effects.
              future_id:
                    future_id represents future uncertainties and is associated with a LHS trial that modifies the base trajectory seen in ref/parameter_ranges.csv
              master_id:
                    master_id is the key for scenarios. It represents the outer product of design_id, time_series_id, future_id, and strategy_id.
              run_id:
                    run_id is a future outcome. It represents the outer product of future_id and strategy_id.

              strategy_id:
                    strategy_id represents different strategies, or collections of levers.
              time_series_id:
                    time_series_id represents uncertainty from different economic trajectories.
                    It is named “time_series_id” so that it can be flexible enough to accommodate different future trajectories.

                    To modify the number of LHS samples to run, open initialize_session.ini and update the value of n_lhs.

                    Before running run_sector_models.py, run experimental_design.py. These scripts are kept separate in order to avoid generating a new experimental design each time the model is run. Note that there is no random seed currently set in experimental_design.py, so each time it is run, a new LHS matrix is generated. All files generated by experimental_design.py are stored in the experimental_design subdirectory.

          b. run_sector_models.py
              run_sector_models.py executes the models specified in each of the sector models scripts. All files generated by run_sector_models.py are stored in the out subdirectory.
              Run this script after running experimental_design.py.
  (3) The sector_model_#SECTOR#.py scripts include the basic sector models. For most of the models, the function takes df_in as an argument, where df_in is generally the master experimental design table (exported as experimental_design_multi_sector.csv).
