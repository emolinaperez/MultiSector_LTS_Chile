I create a module inside the model "For RAND".

It has only four variables that runs the model to get the CO2 and GHG emissions with different leveles of aggregation, should be enough for trying out the model.

Update 23-sep-2020:
It includes a selctor "RandMode" which allows to follow the logic one run one results instead of having differents scenarios.

If you find any problem, please write me at jmvaldes@uc.cl
